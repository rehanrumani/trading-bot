MARCO GLITCH - Render Deployment Package
What's Included
app.py: Complete Flask app with 3Commas integration
three_commas_api.py: 3Commas API handler
config.py: Trading configuration
requirements.txt: Python dependencies
render.yaml: Render service configuration
Deployment Steps
1. Upload Files to Render
Go to your Render dashboard
Select your crypto trading service
Upload all files in this directory
2. Set Environment Variables
In Render dashboard, set these variables:

THREE_COMMAS_API_KEY: Your 3Commas API key
THREE_COMMAS_SECRET: Your 3Commas secret
ACCOUNT_ID: Your 3Commas account ID
3. Deploy
Click "Deploy" in Render dashboard
Wait for deployment to complete
4. Test Endpoints
After deployment, these should work:

GET /health → Service health check
GET /status → 3Commas account status
POST /tv_signal → Execute trades (not just receive)
Expected Behavior
Instead of: {"status": "received"} You should see: {"status": "success", "trade_id": "12345"}

Troubleshooting
Check Render logs for any errors
Verify environment variables are set
Test /health endpoint first
